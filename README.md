## üìú Introduction

Welcome to the Proactive Personalized Ayurvedic Wellness Coach‚Äîa revolutionary application that seamlessly merges the millennia-old wisdom of Ayurveda with the power of Generative AI. 

This isn't just another health tracker; it's your personal digital $\text{Vaidya}$ (Ayurvedic doctor), built to understand your unique biological blueprint (your Doshas) and provide proactive, holistic advice.

Once your Doshas are analyzed, you'll receive custom guidance on Diet ($\text{Ahara}$), Daily Routines ($\text{Dinacharya}$), Lifestyle ($\text{Vihara}$), and Seasonal Adjustments ($\text{Ritucharya}$). Leverage this cutting-edge technology to achieve true balance and optimal well-being.

## ‚ú® Features
Personalized Ayurvedic Assessment: Guides users through a quiz to determine their primary and secondary Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha).

Proactive Wellness Coaching: Provides personalized recommendations for diet, lifestyle, and seasonal routines (Dincharya and Ritucharya) tailored to the user's constitution.

Generative AI Chat Interface: Allows users to chat naturally with the coach for real-time advice and queries.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Uses a vector store (chromadb / faiss-cpu) and embedded domain knowledge (sentence-transformers) to ensure advice is accurate and grounded in authentic Ayurvedic texts.
